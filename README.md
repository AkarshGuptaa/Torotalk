## About the Project

Traditional language learning apps often focus on rote memorization, which can be tedious and ineffective. Torotalk takes a different approach by teaching the rules and logic of Spanish, allowing users to understand and construct sentences naturally.

Torotalk's teaching method includes:
- **Rule-Based Learning**: Explaining how English words translate to Spanish using logical rules.
  - For example, words ending in "ly" in English are transformed to end with "mente" in Spanish (e.g., "quickly" becomes "rápidamente").
  - Words like "preparation" are understood as "preparación" in Spanish, derived from the verb "preparar" (to prepare).
- **Interactive Quizzes**: Reinforcing the learned rules with quizzes after each lesson.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Providing instant correction and scoring to guide learning.

## Features

- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure user sign-up and login.
- **Firestore Integration**: Dynamic storage of quiz questions and answers for easy updates.
- **Text and Quiz Integration**: Lessons followed by quizzes to reinforce learning.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of quiz scores and progress.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for a seamless learning experience.
